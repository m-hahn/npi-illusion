0	yunt	olm	Yes	I have slight eyesight problem (hopefully temporary) and found the speed of the words appearing/disappearing in each sentence rather difficult to keep up with!	0	2	English	£2
1	physs	spraived	Yes	I think I probably got a few wrong, but I did my best. It was difficult sometimes to remember the object of the sentence (e.g. "No papers that were submitted…") by the end of the word sequences, and the short time to reflect made it pretty hard. I enjoyed this task though!	0	2	English	£4.50
2	physs	fonns	Yes		0	2	English	
3	brame	rhould	Yes	It was much harder interpreting the sentences appearing word by word, than it would have been visualising the whole sentence at once.	0	1	English	£2.00

5	praife	squalf	Confused	Hard to distinguish between correct and not correct sentences.	0	0	Danish	£4.50

13	trunce	rhould	Yes	I find it more difficult than I would have imagined. 	0	1	English	£3.50
14	irv	crooch	Yes	Grammatically, many were inaccurate due to the lack of commas that should have been used. However I appreciate this is an American study, so i'm not sure if the grammar rules are consistent with the UK.	0	0	English	£5
15	thomps	therv	Yes	Found it very hard with the words coming up one by one very quickly. Became more intuition of the sentence rather than thought.	0	0	English	£5
16	glab	kolch	Yes	Difficult to see whether you were testing English skills or IT skills or speed thinking?	0	2	English	£5
17	toch	crooch	Yes	I found it challenging the sentence together due to the speed of the lettering, however helped to stimulate the mind. 	0	2	English	
18	anns	twawls	Yes	Gender aspect was noticeable (all secretaries were "he", all tradespeople "she"). If that was part of the experiment it was not subtle. 	0	1	English	£5

23	olm	brirk	Yes	It feels like this was actually looking at sexism at least on some level; or maybe that was just a product of randomised sentences 	0	2	English 	£5

27	cref	fict	Yes	Quite interesting to complete. I believe the speed of the text may have some influence and wonder if the speed remained constant throughout the task. 	0	1	English	£5

34	fruith	trafes	Yes	It was not mentioned if we can rest between the sentences or not. I think mentioning that we can pause would have made a difference as the test is quite eye-tiring.	0	1	Romanian	3£

36	trafes	scorcs	Yes		0	2	English	£4.00
37	rhould	grirped	Yes	I would avoid USA only terms in future to avoid confusion. For instance, I instinctively said the "Math" question was wrong, as here in the UK we use the term "Maths". Thanks! :)	0	2	English	£4.50

40	heaned	lised	Yes	The way the words were presented made it very difficult to recall and consider the sentence as a whole (though if this was the intention it was very effective!).	0	1	English	£4.50

48	duilts	scrib	Yes	It made it hard to read because the words came up so quickly. Maybe this was part of the challenge. But I definitely made some mistakes because of this, whereas if I had more time to read it I would've known the answers.	0	1	english	£5
49	jaund	muic	Yes	The choice to choose yes or no went by too fast, it didn't give me time to think and process the sentence I was just given.	0	1	English	£5.00

52	lann	therv	Yes	Some sentences came faster than others. The ones that came up slightly slower were easier to repeat out loud and work out grammatical errors if they were not initially obvious - however the faster ones were harder to keep up with	0	2	English	£4.50
