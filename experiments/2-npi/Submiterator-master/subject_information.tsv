4	irv	crooch	Yes	Grammatically, many were inaccurate due to the lack of commas that should have been used. However I appreciate this is an American study, so i'm not sure if the grammar rules are consistent with the UK.	0	0	English	£5
5	thomps	therv	Yes	Found it very hard with the words coming up one by one very quickly. Became more intuition of the sentence rather than thought.	0	0	English	£5
